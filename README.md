## Introduction

The **PipBoy Pygame Project** is an interactive application inspired by the iconic Pip-Boy interface from the *Fallout* series. Built using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news), this project simulates various aspects of the Pip-Boy interface, including interactive menus, inventory displays, and dynamic UI elements. It is designed both as a fun project and as a learning tool for Python game development.

I have used the great pipboy project from [Zapwizard](https://github.com/zapwizard/pypboy), but this entire project is built from the ground up.
---

## Features

- **Retro UI Design:** Inspired by the classic Pip-Boy interface with a modern twist.
- **Interactive Menus:** Navigate through different screens such as inventory, stats, and map.
- **Customizable Modules:** Easily add or modify modules (e.g., radio, stats, inventory) to suit your needs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or later:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Pygame:** This project uses Pygame for its graphical interface.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pipboy-pygame.git
   cd pipboy-pygame
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed all the prerequisites and dependencies, running the project is straightforward. Here are some usage tips:

- **Navigation:** Use your keyboard (or mapped controller keys) to navigate through the Pip-Boy interface.
- **Modules:** Switch between different modules like Inventory, Stats, or Map using the on-screen prompts.
- **Customization:** Modify the settings in `config.json` (or your configuration file) to change UI themes, key bindings, or module behavior.
- **Debug Mode:** Launch the application with `--debug` for verbose logging to help troubleshoot any issues.

Example command for debug mode:

```bash
python main.py --debug
```

## Configuration

The application can be customized using a configuration file (`config.json`). This file allows you to modify settings such as:

- **UI Theme:** Change color schemes and fonts.
- **Key Bindings:** Customize keyboard shortcuts for navigation.
- **Module Settings:** Enable or disable specific modules, adjust refresh rates, etc.

Example configuration snippet:

```json
{
  "ui_theme": "retro",
  "key_bindings": {
    "up": "w",
    "down": "s",
    "left": "a",
    "right": "d",
    "select": "enter",
    "back": "esc"
  },
  "modules": {
    "inventory": true,
    "stats": true,
    "map": false
  },
  "debug_mode": false
}
```

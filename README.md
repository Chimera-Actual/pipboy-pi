## Introduction

The **PipBoy Pygame Project** is an interactive application inspired by the iconic Pip-Boy interface from the *Fallout* series. Built using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news), this project simulates various aspects of the Pip-Boy interface, including interactive menus, inventory displays, and dynamic UI elements. It is designed both as a fun project and as a learning tool for Python game development.

I have used the great pipboy project from [Zapwizard](https://github.com/zapwizard/pypboy), but this entire project is built from the ground up.

## Features

- **Retro UI Design:** Inspired by the classic Pip-Boy interface with a modern twist.
- **Interactive Menus:** Navigate through different screens such as inventory, stats, and map.
- **Customizable Modules:** Easily add or modify modules (e.g., radio, stats, inventory) to suit your needs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12 or later:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

It is recommended to first run the project on your windows machine to ensure everything works as expected. Here are the steps to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kelmes1/pipboy-pi.git
   cd pipboy-pi
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

## Usage

Once you have installed all the prerequisites and dependencies, running the project is straightforward. Here are some usage tips:

- **Navigation:** Use your keyboard (or mapped controller keys) to navigate through the Pip-Boy interface.
- **Modules:** Switch between different modules like Inventory, Stats, or Map using the on-screen prompts.
- **Customization:** Modify the settings with `configure.py` to change UI themes, key bindings, or module behavior.
